# Parkinson's disease severity prediction
This library is designed for the Erdos Institute's data science boothcamp project.
## Description

Parkinson's disease affects millions of senior individuals worldwide. 

Parkinson’s disease is considered to have multiple causes, resulting from both genetic and nongenetic factors.

Early detection of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and accurate assessment of disease progression are critical for optimizing treatment and rehabilitation.

but its progression is difficult to predict, causing problems with early intervention and personalized treatment.

This project aims to create a simple AI model that predicts how Parkinson's will progress using genetic and brain imaging data.

This project aims to predict the progression of Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. 

The project utilizes genetic and brain imaging data to create a model that can forecast the severity of Parkinson's disease in patients.

This repository contains code for a project that aims to predict the progression of Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes genetic and brain imaging data to create a model that can forecast the severity of Parkinson's disease in patients. 





## Prerequisites
