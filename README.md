## Description

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting over 1 million people in the United States and over 8.5 million people globally. PD rates are increasing and the diagnosis rate has doubled over the last 25 years (WHO). With no cure in sight, PD remains a complex disease with difficult to predict disease progression. Certain biomarkers, such as combinations of 𝜶-synucleins and inflammation-related biomarkers tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-𝜶 and interleukins (IL) accumulate in PD patients but complex interactions between biomarkers make using them to predict disease progression a challenge (Eidson et al. 2017; Li and Le 2020). Our project aims to utilize data science principles and machine learning to create models that predict PD from demographic, MRI, and biomarker data.

This repository contains code for a project that aims to predict the progression of Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. The project uses data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) open‑access repository. A patient’s baseline genetic profile + MRI biomarkers and demographics, is used to predict the  MDS‑UPDRS Part III (ΔUPDRS III) score (a clinically meaningful measure of motor deterioration).

Stakeholders:
- People with Parkinson’s Disease and their caretakers.
- Pharma and biotech teams running Parkinson’s trials.
- Fellow Researchers working in this field.
- Neurologists.

KPIs:
- Recall : Ensures model correctly identifies patients with PD.
- Feature Importance : Which features are more effective.
  
## Prerequisites
- Access to the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The data sets used in this repo are not available publicly.
- Python 3.x.
- Jupyter Notebook.
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow.
