# Parkinson's disease severity prediction
This library is designed for the Erdos Institute's data science boothcamp project.
## Description
This repository contains code for a project that aims to predict the progression of Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes genetic and brain imaging data to create a model that can forecast the severity of Parkinson's disease in patients. The goal is to develop a simple AI model that can assist in early intervention and personalized treatment plans for individuals with Parkinson's disease.
Parkinson's disease affects millions worldwide, but its progression is difficult to predict, causing problems with early intervention and personalized treatment. This project aims to create a simple AI model that predicts how Parkinson's will progress using genetic and brain imaging data.
